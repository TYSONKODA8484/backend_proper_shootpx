    Two jobs in one pass over every "processing" job, both driven by fal's own
    real queue status:

    1. DELIVERY: as soon as fal reports COMPLETED, the result is fetched and
       applied immediately -- regardless of how much of the tool's budget is
       left. This is what actually resolves jobs whenever the fal webhook
       never arrives, which is ALWAYS the case in local dev: fal's cloud
       cannot reach a PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL of 127.0.0.1, so the webhook is
       never delivered and this poll is the only path that finishes a job.
       This check used to sit behind the budget gate below, which meant a job
       fal had finished in 40s still sat "processing" until its full budget
       elapsed (60s for recolor -- looked fine; 180s for creative_photoshoot
       -- looked broken). In production it's also a genuine safety net for a
       webhook that's lost or arrives late.

    2. TIMEOUT: only once a job is past its own tool's generation_timeout_seconds
       AND fal has not reported it COMPLETED is it failed + refunded. Checking
       fal first matters: our budget elapsing doesn't mean fal's work did too,
       and blindly failing+refunding a job fal already delivered is a real
       money-loss bug.

    Only targets "processing" jobs -- a job still "queued" hasn't been
    submitted to fal yet, so there's nothing to poll and no tool-specific
    budget to measure it against; the 10-minute sweep's flat cutoff still
