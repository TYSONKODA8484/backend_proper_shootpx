# Every model must be imported here so it registers on Base.metadata no
# matter which entry point runs first (FastAPI app, arq worker, or a one-off
# script) -- a model imported only by whichever router happened to need it
# left "users" unregistered for app/worker.py, which touches generation_jobs
# (FK'd to users.id) but never imported app.models.user itself. Any process
# that does `from app.models import *` (or even just imports this package)
# now gets every table registered up front instead of depending on import order.
