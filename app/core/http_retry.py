"""
One retry policy for every outbound HTTP call that talks to fal.ai or Supabase.

Why: an intermittent network stall on a single call used to fail a whole
generation outright ("fal submit failed: The read operation timed out", seen
repeatedly). Those stalls are transient, so a couple of quick retries make
them invisible to the user.

The rules (deliberately identical everywhere, so this can't drift call site to
call site):
  * retry TRANSPORT failures (timeouts, connection errors, dropped/reset
    connections) and HTTP 429 / 502 / 503 / 504;
  * NEVER retry any other 4xx -- 422/400/401/403/404 mean the request itself
    was rejected, so repeating it just fails again (and could cost money);
  * at most 3 attempts, sleeping 1s then 3s between them;
  * after the last attempt the real error propagates unchanged, so the caller's
    existing failure handling (mark failed + refund) is exactly as before.

Callers pass a zero-argument function that performs ONE attempt and returns
the httpx.Response, and still call raise_for_status() themselves.

IMPORTANT: this blocks the calling thread while it sleeps (up to ~4s) and while
each attempt waits (up to 30s each). Never call it directly from an event loop
-- run it in a thread (asyncio.to_thread / run_in_threadpool).
